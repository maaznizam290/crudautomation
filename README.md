Here’s a **professional, human-written README** for your OrangeHRM CRUD automation project. It’s written like a real QA automation engineer would document it for a GitHub repository:

---

# **OrangeHRM – Admin User Management (CRUD) Automation**

This project automates **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** functionality for the **Admin User Management** module of [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers) using **Cypress**.

It follows a **Page Object Model (POM)** structure, making the tests **clean, maintainable, and scalable**.

---

## **Features**

* **UI Automation (Cypress)** for Admin module:

  * Create new Admin users with randomized usernames
  * Search & filter users by username, role, and status
  * Edit existing users’ details (status updates)
  * Delete users and validate their removal
* **Reusable Page Objects** for better maintainability
* **Toast & Table Assertions** to ensure UI feedback consistency
* **Randomized Test Data** to avoid collisions in demo environments
* **Organized Test Suites** using `context()` blocks for logical grouping

---

## **Tech Stack**

* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Framework:** Cypress (v12+)
* **Libraries:**

  * [cypress-xpath](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-xpath) – for robust XPath selectors
* **Reporting:** Mochawesome (optional)

## **Project Structure**

```

    UserManagement/
      adminCRUD.cy.js        # Test suite for Admin CRUD functionality
  pages/
    loginPage.js             # Page Object for login actions
    adminUsersPage.js        # Page Object for user management actions
cypress.config.js            # Cypress configuration
package.json                 # Project dependencies
```

---

## **Setup & Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orangehrm-crud-automation.git
cd orangehrm-crud-automation
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Make sure you have **Node.js** (v14+) installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Run Cypress Tests**

#### Open Cypress Test Runner (interactive mode):

```bash
npx cypress open
```

#### Run all tests in headless mode:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

---

## **Usage**

1. Login credentials are preconfigured for the OrangeHRM demo instance (`Admin / admin123`).
2. Test users are created with **unique usernames** each run (e.g., `AutoUser_ab12cd`).
3. CRUD actions are grouped logically for easy understanding (`context()` blocks).

---

## **Example Test Flow**

* **Create:** Add a new Admin user → verify success toast → confirm user appears in the list.
* **Search:** Query users by username → validate correct records appear.
* **Update:** Change a user’s status to Disabled → verify success toast.
* **Delete:** Remove a user → ensure they no longer appear in the table.

---

## **Reporting**

Mochawesome reporting can be enabled by installing:

```bash
npm install --save-dev mochawesome
```

And configuring it in Cypress.

Would you like me to:

1. **Add GIF/screenshots** of the tests running (for visual appeal in README)?
2. **Include API automation instructions** (for hybrid API + UI CRUD)?
3. **Make it Markdown-styled for direct GitHub upload (with badges)?**

Which do you want — a **minimal clean README** (for internal team use) or a **full polished one** (with visuals & badges for GitHub)?
